  * SECURITY FIX: a cross-site scripting vulnerability with content in the

    patches or some pointers on how to implement the changes)

linbot (1.0.0-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Shift to python2.2.
  * Python 2.2 has nested scopes on by default and warns about using 'from
    foo import *' other than at module level, so fix that.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon,  2 Sep 2002 00:48:40 +0100

    document rather than the confusing "Malformed URL?" (closes: #134620).
  * robotparser.py, schemes.filelink.py: Use the re module instead of the
    obsolete regsub and regex modules.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Jan 2002 17:30:33 +0000

linbot (1.0.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * myUrlLib.py: Import socket so linbot doesn't crash on non-existent URLs
    (closes: #122900).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Dec 2001 11:37:05 +0000

  * New maintainer (closes: #106562). Thanks to Matej Vela in particular for
    doing excellent QA work on linbot.

linbot (1.0.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release early, release often. ;)
  * schemes/ftplink.py: Mostly fixed up.  It now correctly parses URLs
    (see RFC 1738), honors the specified port, handles exceptions from
    FTP.size, closes the connection cleanly, and is actually able to
    retrieve files.  My request for further information bounced, but I
    believe this closes: #45763.
  * linbot.py: Generate relative references to images, using symlinks
    if necessary.  Closes: #75727.

 -- Matej Vela <vela@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Aug 2001 17:09:11 +0200

linbot (1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream version.  As suggested by Gregor Hoffleit, using
    1.0.0 instead of 1.0 to avoid adding an epoch.  Closes: #41080.
  * Package is orphaned; maintainer set to Debian QA Group.  Bugs
    fixed by NMUs can be closed.  Closes: #41345, #45225, #46526.
  * linbot.gif is already included in the package.  Closes: #54861.
  * The upstream site is down indefinitely:
    * config.py: Set WARN_OLD_VERSION to false.
    * debian/copyright: Refer to metalab.  Closes: #54862, #77290.
    * debian/index.html: Left out until it's thoroughly updated.
  * linbot.py: Don't overwrite config.HOSTS.  Closes: #68719.
  * config.py: Applied Kevin Dalley's patch to fix typos in the
    YANKED_URLS example.  Closes: #69899.
  * schemes/httplink.py: Applied Francesco Potorti's patch to reset
    redirect_depth when done with redirections.  Closes: #104408.
  * Converted to debhelper.  The old build system is just too hairy.
  * Restoring upstream layout, moved linbot.py and symlinked config.py
    to .../site-packages/linbot.  Also, since Python prepends the
    script directory to sys.path *after* resolving symlinks, replaced
    the wrapper with a `/usr/bin/linbot -> .../linbot.py' symlink.
  * Conforms to Standards version 3.5.6:
    * Added build dependencies.
    * Conforms to the FHS.  It's worth noting that /usr/lib/linbot has
      been moved to /usr/share/linbot.  Closes: #54860.
    * debian/copyright: Updated reference to GPL.
